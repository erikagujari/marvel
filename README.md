#Marvel Heroes App

##This app intends to fetch a list of heroes and a detail of each of them.

###Details: 
* UI design pattern used is MVVM for basic communication between `ViewController` (`UIKit` based) and `ViewModel`.
* Usage of `Combine` framework to handle network requests and bindings for `MVVM`.
* App Transport Security Settings admits arbitrary loads to download properly images from `Marvel`. In case of centralizing its domain we could just add this specific case.


## Stack:
* Xcode 13
* iOS 15
